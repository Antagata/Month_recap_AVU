Last Saturday we have hosted an extraordinary event in the heart of Zurich, featuring some of the greatest wines from Bordeaux. It is a shame you could not make it. The tasting showcased Bordeaux wines from the 2015 vintage, now reaching 10 years of age since harvest -  a perfect moment to taste them.  The Event was a huge success and the Feedbacks on the wines have been exceptional- The 2015s are showing beautifully and confirm their status as one of Bordeaux’s truly great recent vintages. And even more exceptional, the Chateaux have opened their cellar doors and granted us some direct allocation of their magical 2015 wines. A truly exceptional opportunity to stock up on this incredible year.

With the winemakers present, our clients had a unique opportunity to gain firsthand insights, exchange impressions, and deepen their understanding of what makes the 2015 vintage so remarkable. The list of participants was truly impressive, featuring some of Bordeaux’s most prestigious producers — including estates that rarely attend large tastings of this kind. Thanks to our strong partnerships, long-standing friendships, and our position as one of the world’s largest buyers of top-end wines, we were delighted to welcome an extraordinary lineup. Among them were Cheval Blanc, Pavie, Angélus, La Mondotte, Figeac, Troplong Mondot, Cos d’Estournel, Palmer, Pichon Baron, Pichon Comtesse de Lalande, Montrose, Ducru-Beaucaillou, Lynch-Bages, Pontet-Canet, Pape Clément, La Gaffelière, Clinet, Calon Ségur, Giscours, and Haut-Bailly, just to name a few.
Following the event, the châteaux granted us access to their personal reserves of the 2015 vintages, including some rare large formats. Since you were unable to attend, I wanted to share the list with you — perhaps there are some wines of interest.
Please note that the large formats are extremely limited, in some cases with only a single bottle available. Should anything catch your eye, kindly let me know at your earliest convenience.
