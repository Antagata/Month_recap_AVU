Dear Mr,
The past two weeks have been very busy with major new releases from some of the world’s top wines. In the first week of September, we saw the release of Masseto, Opus One, Solaia, and Almaviva. This past week brought the launch of Grange Penfolds, Concerto, Siepi, a late release of Château Latour 2012 and its second wine, as well as La Vérité and several other prestigious wines from around the world.
With so many releases, it can be challenging to keep track. To simplify things, we have prepared the recap below and an attached overview, which I hope will help guide your decisions. The top 5 best-selling wines—those our clients didn’t want to miss—are:
Galatrona 2023 Solaia 2022 Opus One 2022 Grange Penfolds 2021 Masseto 2022
Below you will also find the most important releases of the week, and in the attachment the full list of releases.
