Dear Client Name,

I hope this message finds you well.
I have not yet had the chance to capture your interest, so I thought I would share a recap of our top-selling wines from last month. Perhaps you might find a moment over the weekend to review it, when there is usually a little more time.
 
September has been an exciting month in the world of fine wine. We achieved our best month ever in terms of sales, driven not only by remarkable new releases but also by some incredible purchases we made from suppliers in need of liquidity. There has never been a better moment to buy wines, and as a company, we have never acquired as much as we did in the past few weeks. Because we buy well, we are able to offer exceptional prices to our loyal clients but also to potential new client like you. Many of our clients are realizing that some of these offers are simply too good to miss, and you have already secured some great wines from us this month — so thank you very much for your support.
 
I know you’re busy and don’t always have time to go through every email — so here’s a snapshot of what has been selling best this month, making sure you don’t miss out on the most successful opportunities.
